### Proposal for DeFi On-chain Dashboard Project

#### Project Overview
**High-Level Goal:** Develop a DeFi On-chain Dashboard for both EVM and Non-EVM Chains, offering comprehensive insights and analytics across multiple blockchain platforms.

#### Description and Motivation
In the rapidly evolving world of decentralized finance (DeFi), the availability and analysis of on-chain data are pivotal for users ranging from retail investors to large financial entities. An on-chain dashboard differs fundamentally from its off-chain counterpart by directly integrating with blockchain data, ensuring real-time updates, and reducing reliance on potentially outdated or manipulated external databases. This project aims to harness the power of on-chain data to provide a transparent, accurate, and decentralized source of DeFi metrics.

The motivation for this project stems from the current limitations in cross-chain DeFi analytics. Many existing tools are restricted to specific blockchains (mostly Ethereum), and there is a significant gap in tools that offer comprehensive insights spanning across both EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and non-EVM chains. By building an on-chain dashboard that aggregates data from diverse blockchain sources, this project will empower users with a unified view of the DeFi ecosystem, enabling better investment decisions and fostering a deeper understanding of market dynamics.

#### Goals and Problem Solving
The primary goal of this project is to create a robust on-chain dashboard that provides real-time DeFi analytics across multiple blockchain networks. This tool will address several critical issues:
- **Interoperability:** By including both EVM and non-EVM chains, the dashboard enhances interoperability and provides a broader market perspective.
- **Transparency and Reliability:** Direct blockchain integration ensures data accuracy, enhancing trust in DeFi metrics presented.
- **User Empowerment:** With better tools at their disposal, users can perform more detailed and informed analysis, which is crucial for managing investments in a volatile market.

The following visualization metrics could be employed, but not limited to:
- **Whale Tracking**
- **Smart Money Tracking**
- **Volume Analysis**
- **Derivative Analysis**


This project is particularly interesting due to the increasing fragmentation of the DeFi landscape. As more chains host significant DeFi activities, a tool that provides an integrated view will be invaluable.

#### Data Collection and Visualization
Data will be crawled from a variety of sources including EVM and Non-EVM chains, utilizing tools such as **Nansen, Messari, The Graph, and CovalentHQ**. These platforms are chosen for their robust APIs and comprehensive coverage of blockchain data. The data collection will focus on key DeFi metrics like total value locked, transaction volumes, wallet activities, and token analytics.
